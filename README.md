This was going to be the start of a Visual Novel idea I started a while back using Raylib (www.raylib.com). Highly recommended for crusty old C programmers. In this demo, I have a car seemingly driving down the road with the background seamlessly repeating. 

The file mockup_backup.c is the code for assembling and displaying the actual VN interface together.
